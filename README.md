# InstapaperClone
Simplified Instapaper Clone

This is a basic version of a simple link bookmarking and parsing site I am working on.
App will currently collect and save links that you would like to read for later, as well as notes on those links.
It is not yet finished and I will be continuing to add functionality to the project, such as:

-Tags, list of tags

-Log in with username and password

-Send saved links to other accounts

This software is not for commercial use or distribution and is currently not offering a license.
