# InstapaperClone
Simplified Instapaper Clone

This is a basic version of a simple link bookmarking and parsing site I am working on.
It is not yet finished and I will be continuing to add functionality to the project, such as:

-Retractable note area for notes on links you save, as well as tags
-Saving/storing your notes on each article
-Tags, list of tags
-Log in with username and password
-Send saved links to other accounts

This software is not for commercial use or distribution.
