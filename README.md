# InstapaperClone
Simplified Instapaper Clone

This is a basic version of a simple link bookmarking and parsing site I am working on.
App will currently collect and save your notes, but it is still being worked on, as it will not empty your note field if you want it to be empty after previously putting text there.
It is not yet finished and I will be continuing to add functionality to the project, such as:

-Tags, list of tags

-Log in with username and password

-Send saved links to other accounts

This software is not for commercial use or distribution and is currently not offering a license.
